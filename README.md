### Post MVP changes
This project is completed within very limited time, so aside from the fact that basic functions within user stories are done, a lot of styling and unit tests are not in place yet. 

Future nice to haves would include:
* Refactor to use `bootstrap` or other library for better styled components
* Put a data processor in the node side for parsing the data
* Write unit tests for major functions
* More functionality/two way activities created(such as for submit button). An arcgis map to show the pickup location as pins on map would also be nice.
